    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by RGB, November 15, 2016</p>
    <p>This week I am <i>extremely</i>excited about a new cooking technique called <cite>sous vide.</cite> In <i>sous vide</i>cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Greeks,</i>jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching."</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Souce Vide</i>Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
